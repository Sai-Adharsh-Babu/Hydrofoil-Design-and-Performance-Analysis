# Hydrofoil Design and Performance Analysis  

## Overview  
The **Hydrofoil Design and Performance Analysis** project focuses on the **aerodynamic and hydrodynamic design** of a hydrofoil intended to improve watercraft efficiency by reducing drag and enhancing lift.  

Developed as part of a **first-year Biomedical Engineering module on Design and CAE**, this project involved a complete cycle of **theoretical analysis**, **CAD design**, and **experimental validation** through **air chamber** and **water tunnel** testing.  

The goal was to understand the fundamental forces acting on a hydrofoil — including **lift, drag, friction, and load-bearing capacity** — and validate theoretical predictions through physical testing.

## Project Scope  
This repository compiles all project deliverables related to the design, analysis, and testing of the hydrofoil, including:  
- **Theoretical calculations** for lift, drag, and flow characteristics.  
- **CAD models** of the hydrofoil and hull integration system.  
- **Experimental results** from air and water tunnel testing.  
- **Comprehensive project report** with design analysis and findings.  

> **Note:** This project was focused on **academic research and concept validation**, not a functional prototype for deployment.

## Technical Overview  
- **Design and Analysis:**  
  The hydrofoil and hull were modeled using *Solid Edge*.  
  The design emphasized aerodynamic efficiency, hydrodynamic stability, and structural strength.  

- **Theoretical Calculations:**  
  All analytical calculations, including **lift and drag coefficients**, **Reynolds number**, and **frictional analysis**, are documented in the project report found in `/docs/Hydrofoil_Project_Report.pdf`.  

- **Experimental Testing:**  
  Tests were conducted in an **air chamber** and **water tunnel** to compare **theoretical vs. actual lift performance**, validating the foil’s design accuracy and efficiency.  

## Experimental Demonstrations  

| **Experiment** | **Description** |
